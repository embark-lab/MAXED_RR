Over the course of the study, we expect both ED and HC groups to meet thresholds of &lt; 20% dropout, zero adverse events, and &gt; 80% task completion.\n\n\n\nWe will characterize changes during exercise in state body image, mood, and biological markers in both ED and HC groups; we will specifically characterize mean levels of, and variability in, biobehavioral response to exercise across the ED and HC groups. We will evaluate exercise-induced changes in DA, 5-HT, BDNF, leptin, and eCB biomarkers for the Prescribed Exercise Task. Shifts in affect, body image, and biomarkers will be evaluated descriptively with measures of central tendency, skew, and variance. We will further characterize shifts in affect and body image through linear mixed effect models.\nSpecific models tested are noted in Table 1.\n\n\n\nTable 1: General Models and Parameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Name\nParameters\n\n\n\n\nOverall Model: Affect and Body Image Variables\nDV ~ 1 + Age + Group + Time + BMI*Condition + Time*Condition + Time*Group*Condition +  (1+Time | Condition: Participant)\n\n\nWithin ED: Affect and Body Image Variables\nDV ~ 1 + Age + Time + BMI*Condition + Time*Condition + Time*Condition +  (1+Time | Condition: Participant)\n\n\nOverall Biomarker Model\nBiomarker ~ 1 + Age + Group + Time + BMI*Condition + Time*Condition + (1 + Time | Condition: Participant)\n\n\nWithin ED: Biomarkers\nBiomarker ~ 1 + Age  + Time + BMI*Condition + Time*Condition + (1 + Time | Condition: Participant)\n\n\nHeterogeneity of Variance across Groups in Exercise Response\n(using nlme)\nDV ~ 1 + Age + Group + Time + Time x Group,\nrandom = list(id = pdDiag(form = ~ Group)),\nweights = varIdent(form = ~ 1 | Group)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe estimated change over time using descriptives, and also ran overall and within ED models using the lme4 package. To evaluate heterogeneity of variance, we incorporated a random effect of group into a model with age, time, group, and group x time fixed effects. We then compared model fit of this model to the model without a random effect of group. To examine potential heterogeneity of within person, a level-1 random effect was then incorporated into the model and compared against a model with between-person (level 2) random effects only.\n\n\n\n\nVisual depiction of raw changes in affect measurements during exercise across groups is presented in Figure 1. Average levels of change from 0 to 30 minutes along with variance in affect across group and condition are presented in Figure 2, and all specific values for average levels of change across groups (30 min vs. BL), maximum increases and maximum decreases from baseline, and variance are presented in Supplemental Table 2. Patterns of results indicate that individuals in the ED group consistently feel more positive and less negative emotion increases across the 30 mins of exercise. Change indicators suggest (ED vs. HC Cohen’s d &gt; .2) that individuals with EDs may feel less ‘crummy’ and more ‘calm’, relative to controls, during exercise. Fatigue increases in the ED group also appear delayed, relative to HC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Affect Change over Exercise - Raw Values\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Affective Change during Exercise (30min vs BL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Affective Variance during Exercise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Description of Affective Changes During Exercise\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel fit indices for each variable and task are presented in Supplmental Table 4.\nMarginal \\(R^2\\) values indicate that fixed effects specified in the current models are, together, accounting for 6-19% of variance in affect during the course of the task, depending on task and variable. Results from each variable in the overall model (see Table 1) are presented in Supplemental Table 3 with estimated marginal means for each timepoint presented in Supplemental Figure 9. Significant Time x Condition interactions indicate that, across both ED and Control groups, participants tended to feel increased fatigue and crumminess, along with reduced calmness during exercise, relative to rest.\nFrom an interpretation of the estimated marginal means, there are initial indications of ED and Control Groups responding differently to tasks. For instance, the ED group exhibited higher negative affect (feeling crummy) in the rest condition of the self-paced task (i.e. when asked to ingest a milkshake and then rest), which may to be mitigated by the opportunity to exercise. The ED group also showed a slower increase in fatigue, relative to the Control group, in both Prescribed and Self-paced Exercise, and a trend toward increased enthusiasm during Prescribed Exercise, relative to a decrease in Enthusiasm in the control group. These potential trends are suggested by graphical depictions; however, the current pilot trial was not sufficiently powered to detect three-way interactions, and no significant Group x Time x Condition interactions emerged in the multi-level model, suggesting that these are likely to be small-to-moderate (rather than large) effects, if they do exist.\nEvaluations of the between and within subject variance across groups via introducing additional random effects and comparing nested models indicated potentially higher within subject variance in fatigue and calmenss during prescribed exercise and fatigue and crumminess during self-paced exercise among the ED group, relative to the HC group (see Supplemental Table 5).\n\n\n\nModel fit indices for each variable and task are presented in Supplmental Table 4. Marginal \\(R^2\\) values indicate that fixed effects specified in the current models are, together, accounting for 3-24% of variance in affect during the course of the task, depending on task and variable. Results within the ED group are presented in Supplemental Table 6. A Time x Condition effect emerged for calmness during the Prescribed exercise task and fatigue during the Self-Paced exercise task. Individuals with EDs reported feeling less calm and more fatigued over time during exercise vs. rest. Futher, older age was associated with feeling less crummy during the Self-Paced task and less Fatigued during the Prescribed task. There were no BMI or BMI x Condition effects, indicating limited impact of BMI on affect during exercise among the ED group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual depiction of raw changes in body image changes during exercise across groups is presented in Figure 3. Average levels of change from 0 to 30 minutes and variance in body image across groups are presented in Figure 4. All specific values for average levels of change across groups (30 min vs. BL), maximum increases and maximum decreases from baseline, and variance are presented in Supplemental Table 7. Patterns of results indicate that individuals in the ED group consistently feel worse about their bodies, although exercise does have some impact on body image. In all measures, individuals with EDs had greater improvements in body image during exericse, as compared to controls. Change indicators suggest (ED vs. HC Cohen’s d &gt; .2) that individuals with EDs specifically feel better about their weight, looks, and appearance, as well as feeling better on average and feeling better than the average person after self-paced exercise and better about their weight after prescribed exercise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Body Image Changes During Exercise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Body Image Change during Exercise (30min vs BL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Body Image Variance during Exercise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Description of Body Image Changes During Exercise\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel fit indices for each variable and task are presented in Supplmental Table 10. Marginal \\(R^2\\) values indicate that fixed effects specified in the current models are, together, accounting for 6-39% of variance in body image during exercise across variable and task. Results from each variable in the overall model (see Table 1) are presented in Supplemental Table 8 with estimated marginal means for each timepoint presented in Figure 5. Group was a significant predictor of all body image items – with the HC group feeling better about their body, relative to the ED group. Higher BMI was assocaited with feeling less attractive than the average person, but there were no significant BMIxCondition effects, indicating that exercise did not influence this effect. There was an overall time effect several items during the Self-Paced condition, with individuals generally feeling better over time. There was also a Group x Time interaction for the BISS average during prescribed exercise, such that individuals in the ED group had greater increases in average BISS scores relative to controls across both exercise and rest. Two Time x Condition x Group interactions emerged. Coupled with an interpretation of marginal means, these interactions indicate that the ED group had more positive increases in feelings about their weight and overall body image during self-paced exercise, relative to the HC group. Evaluations of variance across the two groups also indicates more within person variance in the ED group, as compared to the HC group, on most BISS measurements during exercise (see Supplemental Table 11).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Prescribed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Self-Paced\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: BISS Estimated Marginal Means During Exercise\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel fit indices for each variable and task within the ED group are presented in Supplmental Table 10. Marginal \\(R^2\\) values indicate that fixed effects specified in the current models are, together, accounting for 4-15% of variance in body image during exercise across variable and task. Results for each model within the ED group are presented in Supplemental Table 9. A Time effect emerged for Weight, Appearance, and Average score in the Prescribed Task – individuals felt better about these aspects of body image as the task progressed, regardless of condition (Exercise vs. Rest).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA visual depiction of biomarker response – at both individual and group-aggregate levels – is presented in Figure 6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Individual-Level\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Group Aggregates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Biomarker Measurements Before and After Exercise and Rest\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferences between ED and Control on Pre, Post- Raw Change (Post-Pre) and residualized change scores in biomarkers post-exercise are presented in Figure 7. Full t-test results across both exercise and rest conditions along with tests of heterogeneity of variance in exercise condition response across the ED and Control group using each outcome approach are presented in Supplementary Table 12.\n\n\n\nDifferences between ED and Control on Pre, Post- Raw Change (Post-Pre) and residualized change scores in biomarkers post-exercise are presented in Figure 7, and full t-test results across both exercise and rest conditions using each outcome approach are presented in Supplementary Table 13. # KS NOTE: Not putting any text here yet to explain graphs since we’ll have more biomarker data incoming ##\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Overall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) ED Group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Pre-, Post- , Raw Change, and Residualized Change Scores in biomarkers across ED vs.Control Groups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin the ED group, we will calculate correlations between acute exercise parameters/response and ED-related measures. We will conduct a linear regression to obtain slope estimates for affect and body image shifts for each individual, within exercise condition. We will also conduct a linear regression estimating post-biomarker scores across all individuals with EDs in the exercise condition, saving residuals.\nWe will quantify Pearson correlations with 95% confidence intervals between these slope estimates, biomarker residuals, Self-Paced Task exercise parameters (e.g., average bike speed, HR), functions of exercise subscales, self-report of compulsive exercise, and EDE global scores. We will estimate Pearson correlations and 95% confidence intervals for these correlations.\n\n\nCorrelations between acute exercise response variables are presented in Supplemental Figure 10, and full correlation data with 95% CIs is presented in Table 14. Average zero-order \\(r^2\\) between exercise response variables in the control group is 0.14 and in the ED group is 0.19, indicating slightly stronger association between exercise response variables in the ED group, relative to the control group, with little evidence of collinearity across exercise response measures – indicating relative independence of exercise response measures across the three domains of assessment.\n\n\n\nCorrelations between exercise response variables with key variables of interest are presented in Figure 8. Full correlation data with 95% CIs is presented in Table 15. Average zero-order \\(r^2\\) between acute exercise response and key variables of interest in the control group is 0.08 and in the ED group is 0.1. For only those in the ED group only, greater body image response to acute exercise was associated with key variables, including higher self-reported drive for muscularity, higher social negative reinforcement, lower social positive reinforcement, lower body mass index, and lower weight suppression. Increases in feeling crummy during Prescribed exercise were associated with higher BMI and lower MVPA in the control group only, and higher social positive reinforcement for exercise in both groups. Perceived Exertion during prescribed exercise was associated with higher drive for muscularity only for the ED group, and feeling crummy during self-paced exercise was associated with lower exertion during exercise across groups. For the control group, but not the ED group, feeling crummy during self paced exercise was associated with higher BMI and lower weight suppression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Correlations between Exercise Response and Individual Difference Variables"
